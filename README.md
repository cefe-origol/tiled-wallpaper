# Tiled wallpaper
I had this idea a while ago. I think the original inspiration was [a chipflake video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7viImr6bF8&t=40). Never really started it because computational geometry sucks.

Yesterday decided to actually do it, but gave myself only 24 hours to ensure I finished it. 25 hours later, here's the result.

It uses some cool stuff:
  - Convex hull cutting
  - Graph Colouring
  - Backtracking
  - Triangle filling
  - Convex hull tesselation

Is it good? Not at all. But it works well enough. Decided to publish it in case someone wants to do something with it, maybe learn something, or even just take inspiration like I did for this project.
